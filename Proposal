# P5.JS Audio player

I propose to design and code a web audio player in p5.js, with a built in library and features such as pause, seek, etc.

## Summary

Being a big music fan and really into design, I'm really interested in how far I can push the capabilities of p5 to build an appealing web audio player. I would like to first spend some time thinking about the interface, and then try to map out how some features would work before actually getting to code.

## Component parts

None except for a code editor (most likely Atom), since this will be a code-only project.

## Challenges

- I anticipate running into a lot of challenges with the code getting too complex for p5, so I might need to do some research and use JavaScript instead.
- I'm also not very used to the p5 sound library, so I'd need to do some research about that as well.
- Adding the audio features might be really challenging, for example, to seek in an audio track, I would need to convert the location of the mouse on a track into something p5 can understand and seek to.
- It might also be very challenging getting a good match of the design I map out, so it might just be better to paste a .PNG of it.

##Timeline

 Week 1: Present proposal, start mapping out how features would work/the interface
 Week 2: Start the code
 Week 3: Coding
 Week 4: Present
